# car-plate-recognition
Using EasyOCR for car plate recognition involves leveraging the capabilities of EasyOCR, an open-source Python package, along with OpenCV. Here are some key points extracted from the search results:
EasyOCR is a Python library that simplifies Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tasks, including license plate recognition. It supports over 80 languages and is user-friendly
2
.
When implementing license plate recognition with EasyOCR and OpenCV, it's essential to consider factors like lighting, image preprocessing, and other variables that can affect the accuracy of plate detection
2
.
The process involves loading and resizing the image, preprocessing it, initializing the EasyOCR reader object, and then detecting the text from the license plate
2
.
It's crucial to ensure compatibility between OpenCV and EasyOCR by downgrading OpenCV to version 4.5.4.60 if needed for seamless integration
2
.
License Plate Recognition (LPR) systems like those using EasyOCR play a vital role in various applications such as ticketless parking, tolling, stolen vehicle detection, and smart billing. These systems provide detailed data about vehicles passing through specific areas
